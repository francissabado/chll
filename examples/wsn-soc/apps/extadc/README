ExtADC -- Sensor Interface to an External ADC
---------------------------------------------

 - 1st FSM to query one value from the external ADC
 - 2nd FSM to request a new measurement and compare with old value
 - both FSMs are implemented within the ExtADC top module
 - this application does identical post-processing as ADT7310 and MAX6682
