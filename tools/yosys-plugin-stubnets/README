This is the "Stubnets" plugin for Yosys. It was developed by Clifford Wolf
and improved by Johann Glaser. It is free and unencumbered software
released into the public domain. Johann Glaser also added
stubnets-verbose.cc which prints large amounts of debug info. See also the
subdirectory /manual/CHAPTER_Prog/ of the Yosys source tree.
