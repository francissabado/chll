MAX6682 -- Sensor Interface to Maxim MAX6682 SPI Temperature Sensor
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 - 1st FSM to query one value from the sensor
 - 2nd FSM to request a new measurement and compare with old value
 - both FSMs are implemented within the MAX6682 top module
 - the sensor uses a much simpler protocol than ADT7310
 - this application does identical post-processing as ADT7310
