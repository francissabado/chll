How to do power analysis?
-------------------------
1) Generate the vsim.do QuestaSim script, e.g.:
   $ ./sim.sh -max Testchip2CHLL-ADT7310

2) Setup the testpoints in power-testpoints.tcl or change the name of the
   sourced testpoint file in vsim.do to another file.

3) Execute QuestaSim:
   $ vsim -do vsim.do &
   and watch the VCD file growing
   $ dir /opt/tmp/test.vcd.gz
   During simulation, "vcd2saif" command lines are printed and saved in the
   QuestaSim "transcript" file, so be sure this is enabled. This also
   includes the start and end times of the interesting intervals.

4) Generate a script to convert the VCD file to SAIF files:
   $ grep vcd2saif transcript | cut -d' ' -f 3- > /tmp/vcd2saif-1.sh
   $ cat /tmp/vcd2saif-1.sh
   and quit QuestaSim to avoid invalid GZip file ending.

5) Convert the VCD file to SAIF files:
   $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dc/2009_06/bin
   $ . /tmp/vcd2saif-1.sh

6) Adapt the Power Analysis script for DesignCompiler (and ensure it has the
   same setup as used during simulation).

7) Execute the Power Analysis in ../../../power/run/:
   $ ./run.sh

TODOs:
------
 - Save the "vcd2saif" command lines to a dedicated script file so no "grep"
   stuff is required.
 - Or even better, directly execute the vcd2saif command, because this is a
   bit faster for the first few testpoints because the VCD file is not that
   big yet. But a problem could be that the VCD file is written block-wise
   and its end doesn't comply to the GZip format before QuestaSim is
   stopped.
